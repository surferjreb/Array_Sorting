# Array_Sorting
This is an example of a Bubble sort for an array of numbers.  Depending on which way the less than or greater than sign is pointing in the sortArray() method found in the ArrayNumberSort Class decides how the numbers will be ordered when complete.  The program does not currently implement Excetion catching, but will in the next version.
